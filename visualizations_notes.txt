Visualizations - README
========================

Overview
--------
Generates statistical comparison plots between male and female fighters, including distribution comparisons, correlation analysis, and feature importance for predicting wins.

Data Processing
---------------
1. Loads fighter_stats_with_gender.csv
2. Separates fighters by gender (MALE/FEMALE)
3. Filters to top 1000 fighters per gender, ranked by total wins
4. Handles missing values: drops NaN for distributions, imputes mean for ML models

Visualization Types
------------------
1. Distribution Plots (4 plots):
   - KDE probability distributions comparing male vs female
   - Features: height, weight, reach, age
   - Displays mean, std, sample size statistics
   - Output: {feature}_distribution_gender_comparison.png

2. Correlation Heatmaps (2 plots):
   - Correlation matrix between all numeric features and wins
   - Separate plots for male and female fighters
   - Upper triangle masked, coolwarm colormap
   - Output: correlation_heatmap_{gender}.png

3. Feature Importance Plots (2 plots):
   - Random Forest regression to predict wins from features
   - Feature importance scores displayed as horizontal bars
   - Separate models for male and female
   - Output: feature_importance_{gender}.png

Output
------
Total: 8 plots (4 distributions + 2 correlations + 2 feature importance)
All saved as PNG files (300 DPI) to plots/ directory
