MMA Fights Visualization - README
==================================

Overview
--------
Interactive visualization of professional MMA fighters and title fights across the globe. Three linked SVGs display geographic distribution, fighter statistics, and fight details.

Data Sources
------------
- countries.geo.json: World map GeoJSON data
- pro_mma_fighters.csv: Fighter profiles (name, country, wins/losses breakdown)
- per_fight_data.csv: Individual fight records (fighters, odds, winners, locations)

SVG 1: Globe Map (Left, 800x800px)
-----------------------------------
Functionality:
- World map using D3 Natural Earth projection
- Countries colored: green (#2d8b57) if they have fighters, gray (#3b4a5a) otherwise
- Hover highlights country with white border
- Drag to pan the map
- Zoom slider (0.6x - 2.5x) with real-time value display
- Graticule lines and radial gradient water background

Interactivity:
- Hovering a country updates the two right panels
- Panning updates projection translation
- Zoom updates projection scale

Design:
- Dark theme with gradient water (#1f3b56 to #0b1724)
- Subtle graticule overlay (15% opacity white)
- Country borders with hover feedback

SVG 2: Fighter Statistics (Middle, 800x800px)
----------------------------------------------
Functionality:
- Displays top fighters from hovered country, sorted by wins (descending)
- Shows up to 8 fighters per country
- Each fighter displays:
  - Name, nickname, age, height, weight
  - Stacked horizontal bars for wins (KO/Sub/Dec/Other)
  - Stacked horizontal bars for losses (KO/Sub/Dec/Other)
  - Total win/loss counts

Color Scheme:
- Wins: Red (#f97373), Purple (#a855f7), Blue (#3b82f6), Gray (#9ca3af)
- Losses: Dark Red (#dc2626), Dark Purple (#9333ea), Dark Blue (#2563eb), Dark Gray (#6b7280)
- Legend shows both win and loss colors for each outcome type

Design:
- Dark panel background (#050814) with rounded corners
- Bars scale proportionally to max wins/losses in displayed set

SVG 3: Title Fights (Right, 800x800px)
--------------------------------------
Functionality:
- Displays title fights that occurred in hovered country
- Card-based layout (85px height per fight)
- Each fight card shows:
  - R_fighter (red, left) vs B_fighter (blue, right)
  - Gold medal emoji (🥇) next to winner
  - Odds bars: horizontal bars proportional to implied probabilities (renormalized to 100%)
  - Odds conversion: negative odds → |odds|/(|odds|+100), positive → 100/(odds+100)
  - Metadata: date, location, weight class, gender

Design:
- Card layout with rounded rectangles (#0f1724 background)
- Red/blue color coding for fighters matches corner assignments
- Odds bars use same red/blue colors, width represents probability
- Winner indicated by gold medal emoji
- Empty state when no country selected or no title fights

Interactivity
-------------
- All three SVGs are linked: hovering a country on the globe updates both right panels
- Globe supports pan (drag) and zoom (slider)
- No click interactions - hover-only for country selection

Design Theme
------------
- Dark color scheme throughout (#050814, #0f1724 backgrounds)
- Gradient text header (red to blue)
- Consistent typography (system fonts)
- Rounded corners and subtle borders
- Professional, modern aesthetic

Technical Notes
---------------
- D3.js v7 for data binding and SVG manipulation
- Natural Earth projection for world map
- Flexbox layout for three-panel arrangement
- Data pre-processed into country-based lookups for performance
- Winner field in fight data uses "Red"/"Blue" not fighter names
