Fighters Over Time Visualization - README
==========================================

Overview
--------
Generates time series plots showing fighter performance metrics (wins, win rate, fights) over years for top fighters by gender.

Data Processing
---------------
1. Loads per_fight_data.csv and parses dates (M/D/YYYY format)
2. Extracts year from each fight date
3. For each fight, determines winner (Red/Blue) and assigns wins/losses to both fighters
4. Aggregates statistics per fighter per year: wins, losses, fights, win_rate
5. Filters fighters: minimum 5 total fights and 3+ years of data
6. Aggregates across all weight classes (ignores weight class boundaries)

Fighter Selection
-----------------
- Selects top N fighters per gender (default: 2) ranked by total wins
- Aggregates all fight data across weight classes for selected fighters

Plot Generation
---------------
Creates 6 plots total (3 features × 2 genders):
- Features: wins per year, win rate, fights per year
- One line per fighter, color-coded
- X-axis: year, Y-axis: feature value
- Win rate formatted as percentage (0-100%)
- Saved as PNG files (300 DPI) to plots/ directory

Output Files
------------
Format: {feature}_over_time_top{N}_{gender}.png
Example: wins_over_time_top2_male.png
